## 📊 Decoding the world, one dataset at a time.

I'm Giren Martiano Yero — an aspiring **Data Analyst** currently diving deep into the world of data.  
I'm learning how to clean, analyze, and visualize data using modern tools and technologies.

🔍 **Currently Exploring:**
- 📊 Data Analytics fundamentals
- 🐍 Python for data (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- 🧮 SQL for querying structured data
- 📈 Data visualization tools (Power BI, Tableau)
- 📚 Statistics and data storytelling

🚀 **My Goals:**
- Build real-world projects that turn raw data into clear, actionable insights
- Develop strong analytical thinking and problem-solving skills
- Contribute to open-source data projects & collaborate with fellow data learners

📁 **This GitHub is my learning journal.**  
You’ll find notebooks, mini-projects, visualizations, and experiments — all part of my journey to become a professional Data Analyst.

📫 Feel free to connect or drop suggestions — I'm always open to feedback and collaboration!
